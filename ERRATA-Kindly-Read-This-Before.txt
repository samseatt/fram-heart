(1) In the PDF report "Conclusion"" section there is a typo:
  It says Linear Regression. It is meant to say *Logistic* Regression. Logistic Regression was the final selection for training the Framingham Heart Study dataset.
  
(2) The report mentions logical regression at another place. Again, it is meant to say "logistic" regression

(3) I forget to add this to the "References"" section:
